# Overlapp — Session Handoff

> Created 2026-06-03. Purpose: let a fresh Claude Code session resume exactly where the
> previous one left off. Read this first, then `CLAUDE.md` → `docs/SPEC.md` → `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`.

## TL;DR — where we are

**Phase 2 (calendar sync) is COMPLETE and tested (2026-06-04)**, along with the remaining P1
follow-ups (avatar upload + account deletion). Built this session:
- **Google Calendar OAuth** — a standalone *calendar-access* flow (NOT login): `connectGoogle()`
  → consent (`access_type=offline&prompt=consent`) → `/api/calendars/google/callback` exchanges
  the code, stores tokens in **`calendar_secrets`** (service-role-only; never client-readable,
  §9-C), writes a **`calendars`** metadata row, and runs a first sync.
- **Sync worker** (`src/lib/google/{oauth,calendar,sync}.ts` + `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`):
  refreshes tokens, pulls `calendar.readonly` events for a −1d…+60d window (`singleEvents=true`),
  **upserts** into **`events`** *without* clobbering the user's `override`. Incremental via
  Google `syncToken` (`calendars.sync_cursor`); 410 → full resync.
- **Overrides** — per-event + per-category (**`category_overrides`**) free/blocked. Effective busy
  = event override → category rule → `provider_busy`, resolved in the **extended availability RPCs**
  (new `effective_event_busy_intervals` helper folded into `my_busy_intervals` /
  `group_busy_intervals` / `group_heatmap` — same signatures, so the heatmap UI was unchanged).
- **Background re-sync** — `/api/cron/sync-calendars`, `CRON_SECRET`-bearer-protected (Vercel Cron
  or any pinger). **`/calendars` page** drives connect/disconnect/sync-now + the override toggles.
- **P1 follow-ups** — avatar upload (public `avatars` storage bucket + owner-scoped RLS) and
  account deletion (dissolves owned groups + deletes the auth user via the service role).
- **Setup:** [`docs/GOOGLE-SETUP.md`](GOOGLE-SETUP.md). Without `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` the
  Calendars page shows a "not configured" notice and the rest of the app is unaffected.

**Migrations are applied LOCALLY only** (3 new files; `db:reset` clean, types regenerated). They
are **NOT yet on the hosted PRODUCTION project** — apply via Supabase MCP `apply_migration` after
review, then regenerate types. The live Google OAuth round-trip needs real credentials (manual
check, `GOOGLE-SETUP.md §5`). **Next: Phase 3** (multi-date proposals — `DATA-MODEL.md §10`).

---

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE and tested (2026-06-04).** The full core loop works end-to-end: auth
(signup/login/verify/logout), onboarding, profile, dashboard, group create/edit/manage, the
invite flow (Web Share token links + email-keyed pending invites + public preview + redeem),
the manual-block availability editor (incl. weekly RRULE), and the **group heatmap** rendered in
the viewer's local time. Backend: all P1 migrations applied **locally and to the hosted project
via MCP** — `manual_blocks`, the availability RPCs (`expand_block_occurrences` RRULE expander,
`my_busy_intervals`, de-identified `group_busy_intervals`, on-the-fly `group_heatmap`), the group
management RPCs (`dissolve_group` = the §9-E soft-delete write path, `transfer_group_ownership`,
a role-integrity guard), and a `pending_member_visibility` fix. Security advisors: only the
intentional `security_definer_function_executable` WARNs.

**Next: Phase 3** — multi-date proposals, nudges, quorum, calendar write-back (`DATA-MODEL.md §10`).
(Phase 2 calendar sync is done — see the TL;DR above and `docs/GOOGLE-SETUP.md`.)

**Testing.** `docs/TESTING.md` is the durable strategy: **27 unit + 53 integration (80) green**,
plus a **Playwright e2e/visual layer** (`npm run test:e2e`) that drives the whole loop as a user,
screenshots every screen, and deletes the screenshots after review. Run integration/e2e against
the **local** stack (`npm run db:start` → `npm run db:reset` → `npm run test` / `npm run
test:e2e`). After any migration: `npm run db:reset` + regenerate DB types. Never run against the
hosted project.

**Soft-delete (was a TODO, now RESOLVED):** a direct `UPDATE deleted_at` is blocked by RLS, so
group dissolution goes through the `dissolve_group(uuid)` `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC
(`…_create_group_management_rpcs`; `DATA-MODEL.md §9-E`). Covered by `group-management.test.ts`.

## Why this handoff exists

Continuity between sessions: lets a fresh Claude Code session resume without re-deriving state.

**Supabase MCP is connected and working** (used to apply migrations this session). If a new
session shows it disconnected: run `/mcp` → authenticate (browser OAuth). MCP servers load only
at startup, so a freshly-edited `.mcp.json` needs a restart.

## Project facts

- **Path:** `/Users/apersad/Documents/Development/PersonalProjects/overlapp`
- **Stack:** Next.js 16.2.7 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19.2.4, TypeScript, Tailwind 4,
  `src/` dir, `@/*` alias. Supabase backend. Mobile-first PWA.
- **⚠️ Next.js 16 caveat:** This Next.js has breaking changes vs. training-data knowledge
  (see `AGENTS.md`). **Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing app code** — esp.
  async `cookies()`/`headers()` and middleware patterns, which matter for `@supabase/ssr`.
- **Git:** repo at `overlapp/`. `main` has foundation + groups + invites merged (PRs #1, #2, #3).
  **All Phase 1 work (DB availability/management layer + the full app UI) is committed on branch
  `feature/phase-1-complete`** — one commit, not yet pushed or PR'd (awaiting the user's go-ahead).
- **Supabase project ref:** `qildwjcnzyejgjvnyohi` (Americas region). ⚠️ **This is the PRODUCTION
  project — there is no separate dev project.** Always develop + test against the **local** stack
  first (`db:reset` + full suite green) before applying anything here. Security settings: Data API
  ON, auto-expose-new-tables OFF, automatic-RLS ON (new tables get RLS auto-enabled → every table
  needs explicit grants + policies in its migration or it's deny-all).

## What's DONE

### Documentation (all committed)
- `docs/SPEC.md` — product spec (problem, decisions, journeys, roadmap). Source of truth.
- `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` — **finalized** Postgres/Supabase schema, RLS posture, build order (§12).
  Locked decisions: RRULE recurrence · Vault server-only OAuth tokens · soft-delete (`deleted_at`)
  · on-the-fly heatmap RPC for P1 · email mirrored into `profiles` via signup trigger.
- `docs/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md` — anti-AI-slop UI guardrails. Visual design was deferred until P1's
  core loop worked; that gate has **now cleared**, so a deliberate design pass is unblocked.
  Sketch/reference-first; heatmap is the hero; one accent color; color must survive colorblindness.
- `docs/EMAIL-SETUP.md` + `docs/email-templates/*.html` — Resend auth email.

### Infra
- **Supabase project** provisioned (ref above).
- **`.env.local`** populated by the user with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` +
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. `.env.example` is the committed template. `.env*` is gitignored.
- **Resend auth email** wired: custom SMTP (`smtp.resend.com:465`, user `resend`, pass = API key),
  sending from `noreply@payroll.persadpay.com`. Branded templates in `docs/email-templates/`
  (user pastes into Supabase → Authentication → Emails → Templates).
  - DNS for `persadpay.com` is at **Vercel** (registered at GoDaddy, nameservers → Vercel).
  - Deliverability: user adding a **DMARC** TXT record at Vercel
    (`_dmarc` → `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:akpersad@gmail.com`). Status: in progress / verify.
- **Supabase MCP server** configured in `.mcp.json` (hosted HTTP `mcp.supabase.com`,
  scoped to project ref, OAuth — no token in repo). **Mode: WRITE-enabled** (user chose this; MCP
  can run migrations/SQL directly). **Connected and in active use** (applied the invites migration).
- **Supabase CLI** also installed (`npx supabase`, v2.104.0) as a devDependency — fallback/option
  for versioned migrations. Docker is available for `supabase start` (local dev) if wanted.

### Phase 1 — application code (first slice, committed)

- **`profiles` migration** (`supabase/migrations/`), applied via the Supabase MCP and saved as
  files whose names match the remote ledger version (so `supabase db push` won't try to replay):
  - `…_create_profiles.sql` — `public.profiles` (email mirror + soft-delete `deleted_at`), a
    shared `set_updated_at()` trigger, the `handle_new_user()` signup trigger (mirrors
    `auth.users` → profile; reads `first_name`/`last_name`/`time_zone` from signup metadata),
    RLS enabled with **self read/update** policies + `authenticated` grants.
  - `…_harden_trigger_functions.sql` — pins `set_updated_at`'s `search_path` and revokes RPC
    `EXECUTE` on the trigger funcs. Security advisor now clean except Supabase's own
    `rls_auto_enable` (platform function, not ours).
  - **Deferred on purpose** (tables don't exist yet, noted in the SQL): co-member profile-read
    policy → comes with `group_members`; `pending_invites` auto-join → extends
    `handle_new_user()` in the invites migration.
- **`@supabase/ssr` scaffold** under `src/lib/supabase/`: `config.ts` (validated env),
  `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts` (async-`cookies()` server client), `database.types.ts`
  (generated — regenerate after every migration). 
- **`src/proxy.ts`** — Next 16 renamed `middleware`→`proxy` (`export function proxy`, **Node
  runtime only**, `getAll`/`setAll` cookie pattern). Refreshes the session + gates routes; public
  prefixes: `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/verify-email`, `/auth`, `/invite` (all now built).
  NOTE: proxy is **not** a hard security boundary — RLS + per-action auth checks are.
- **Starter cleanup:** `layout.tsx` metadata and the `globals.css` Arial override fixed (done in
  the first slice); landing `page.tsx` rewritten as the real marketing page.
- **Verified:** `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, and `next build` all green.
- The multiple-lockfiles `next build` warning is silenced via `turbopack.root` in
  `next.config.ts` (also sets `allowedDevOrigins: ['127.0.0.1']` for the Playwright dev server).

### Phase 1 — migrations since the first slice

- **`groups` + `group_members`** (`20260603210859` + fixes `…211217`, `…214316`): enums, 15-cap
  trigger, owner-auto-membership, `SECURITY DEFINER` membership helpers, full RLS.
- **`group_invites` + `pending_invites`** (`20260604003050_create_invites`): token-link invites,
  `get_invite_preview`/`redeem_group_invite` RPCs, email normaliser, `handle_new_user()` auto-join.
- **`manual_blocks`** (`20260604032458`): owner-only RLS, RRULE column, time-order check.
- **availability RPCs** (`20260604032606`): `expand_block_occurrences` (RRULE expander, UTC-pinned,
  bounded iteration; supports FREQ DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY + INTERVAL/COUNT/UNTIL/BYDAY),
  `my_busy_intervals` (SECURITY INVOKER), de-identified `group_busy_intervals` (member-gated, no
  label — the privacy boundary), on-the-fly `group_heatmap` (member-gated, everyone-free flag,
  45-day window cap).
- **group management RPCs** (`20260604032639`): `dissolve_group` (the §9-E soft-delete write path),
  `transfer_group_ownership`, and a `guard_member_role` trigger enforcing the single-owner /
  no-direct-owner-promotion invariant.
- **`pending_member_visibility`** (`20260604032655`): self-row SELECT policy on `group_members` +
  an any-status `has_group_membership()` group SELECT policy, so a pending member sees the group
  (and the post-redeem redirect resolves) but still gets no member availability.

All four were applied via the Supabase MCP to the hosted project and saved as files whose
timestamps match the recorded ledger versions. `get_advisors` (security) shows only the intentional
`security_definer_function_executable` WARNs.

### Phase 1 — application UI (complete)

Full app under `src/app/` (Next 16 App Router, Server Actions, `@supabase/ssr`):
- **Public:** landing (`page.tsx`), `login`, `signup`, `verify-email`, `auth/confirm` (email-OTP
  route handler), `invite/[token]` (public preview via `get_invite_preview` + redeem).
- **Authenticated** (route group `(app)`, shell in `(app)/layout.tsx` with `AppNav`): `onboarding`,
  `profile`, `dashboard`, `groups/new`, `groups/[id]` (heatmap + members + invites + approvals +
  dissolve/leave/transfer), `groups/[id]/edit`, `availability` (block editor).
- **Shared:** Server Actions in `src/lib/actions/{auth,groups,profile,blocks}.ts`; DAL
  `src/lib/auth.ts` (`getUser`/`requireUser`/`requireProfile`, React-`cache`d); pure helpers
  `src/lib/{format,rrule,ui}.ts`; components `src/components/{AppNav,AuthCard,Avatar,LocalTime}.tsx`.
- **Heatmap** (`groups/[id]/heatmap.tsx`, client): weekly grid in viewer-local time, single-hue
  intensity ramp + free-count text (colourblind-safe), week nav, queries `group_heatmap`.
- **Invites** use the **Web Share API** (native share sheet) with clipboard fallback.

## Phase 1 build log (all DONE)

Every step of the `DATA-MODEL.md §12` build order shipped. Kept here as the decision/bug record;
**there is nothing left to do in Phase 1 — start Phase 2** (see TL;DR).

1. ~~**`groups` + `group_members`** migration (`DATA-MODEL.md §3`): two tables, the enums
   (`member_role`, `member_status`, `join_control`), the **15-member-cap** trigger, and RLS
   (members read; admins/owner write); unlocks the co-member profile-read policy.~~ **DONE.**
2. ~~**`group_invites` + `pending_invites`** (`§4`–`§5`): token-link invites, email-keyed pending
   invites, the invite-preview `security definer` RPC, and **extend `handle_new_user()`** to
   consume `pending_invites` on signup (the auto-join).~~ **DONE** — migration
   `20260604003050_create_invites` (applied via MCP + file). Adds both tables with admin-managed
   RLS; `get_invite_preview(token)` (SECURITY DEFINER, anon + authenticated — name/inviter/
   member-count/join-policy only, no roster/availability; empty for revoked/expired/used-up);
   `redeem_group_invite(token)` (SECURITY DEFINER, authenticated — open→active / approval→pending,
   idempotent, `FOR UPDATE` + `use_count` bump, 15-cap still applies); a `lower(trim())` email
   normaliser trigger; and `handle_new_user()` extended to consume matching `pending_invites` on
   signup (per-group attempt wrapped so a full group's `check_violation` is skipped, never blocking
   account creation). 12 integration tests added (`tests/integration/invites.test.ts`).
   Advisor note: `get_invite_preview`/`redeem_group_invite` show WARN
   `*_security_definer_function_executable` — **intentional** (client-callable RPCs), same accepted
   pattern as the existing `is_group_*`/`shares_group_with` helpers.
3. ~~**`manual_blocks`** (`§7`) → **`my_busy_intervals` / `group_busy_intervals`** + **heatmap
   RPC** (`§8`, on-the-fly per `§9-B`).~~ **DONE** — migrations `…_create_manual_blocks`,
   `…_create_availability_rpcs`, `…_create_group_management_rpcs` (+ `dissolve_group` resolving the
   §9-E soft-delete TODO), `…_pending_member_visibility`. Integration: `availability.test.ts`,
   `group-management.test.ts`.
4. ~~Then the UI: auth, group create/join + invite share/preview/redeem flow, manual-block
   editor, heatmap.~~ **DONE** — full app under `src/app/` (route group `(app)` for the
   authenticated shell; `login`/`signup`/`verify-email`/`auth/confirm`/`invite/[token]` public).
   Server Actions in `src/lib/actions/`, DAL in `src/lib/auth.ts`, pure helpers in
   `src/lib/{format,rrule,ui}.ts`. Playwright e2e in `tests/e2e/`.

**→ Phase 1 is finished. Continue with Phase 2 (calendar sync) — see TL;DR above.**

**Migration workflow reminder:** apply via Supabase MCP `apply_migration` **and** save a matching
file in `supabase/migrations/` whose timestamp matches the version the ledger recorded (check with
MCP `list_migrations`), then regenerate `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts`. Run `get_advisors`
(security) after DDL and clear anything you introduced. Never edit an already-applied migration —
add a new one.

## Open decisions / reminders

- **Visual design** was deferred until P1's core loop worked — it now does, so a proper design
  pass (per `DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md`: sketch-first, heatmap-as-hero, one accent, colourblind-safe) is
  now **unblocked**. Current UI is intentionally functional/minimal Tailwind, not the final look.
- **Auth:** email+password is built. Google OAuth login is still optional/later (doubles as
  calendar consent in P2). Local Supabase has `enable_confirmations = false` (signups auto-confirm,
  which is what e2e relies on); **prod will confirm by email** — the `/auth/confirm` route + the
  `verify-email` page handle that path, and Resend prod email depends on DMARC landing.
- **Account deletion UI** and **avatar upload** are now **built** (this session). Deletion
  dissolves owned groups + deletes the auth user via the service role (profile page → Danger zone);
  avatar upload uses the public `avatars` storage bucket with owner-scoped RLS.
- **PWA** (installable manifest, service worker, Web Push) is **Phase 4**, not done.
- **MCP write mode is enabled against the PRODUCTION DB** (convenience + prompt-injection risk).
  No real user data yet, but treat every MCP `apply_migration`/`execute_sql` as a production change:
  test locally first, prefer reversible DDL, and consider switching the MCP server to read-only
  (or spinning up a separate dev project / branch) before real users land.

## Persistent memory

This in-repo file (plus `CLAUDE.md`) is the authoritative, detailed handoff — read it first.
(If a user-level `overlapp-project` memory note exists from an earlier session, treat this file as
the source of truth where they disagree.)
